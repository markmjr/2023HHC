## Introduction

This year's Holiday Hack has moved to warmer climates, but not all is sunshine and rainbows.

With the assistance of the AI ChatNPT, infrastructure has been stood up, but there are concerns and so we are brougt in to evaluate. 

We check in at Orientation, collect our badge, a fishing pole and our own boat and set sail.  

AI tools are currently all the rage. There is a lot of evidence that, when done right, AI tools are a game changer. Being able to assist in dealing with large datasets, being able to provide feedback quickly on those datasets, and helping to improve productivity.

However, this is still a newer technology, and the ramifications and flaws are still being discovered. Whether it's bad training data, poor prompting, or data privacy concerns, there's a lot to work out.

Let's strive to work through these challenges so we can traverse these waters well, and not get shipwrecked in this storm.



??? tip "Navigation tip"
    Even with less than 50 pages, there's still quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:

## Conclusion

!!! Abstract "Narrative"
    Just sit right back and youâ€™ll hear a tale,<br/>
    A tale of a yuletide trip<br/>
    That started from a tropic port,<br/>
    Aboard this tiny ship<br/>
    Santa and his helpful elves<br/>
    To Geese Islands did go<br/>
    Continuing their merry work<br/>
    O'er sand instead of snow<br/>
    New this year: a shiny tool<br/>
    The elves logged in with glee<br/>
    What makes short work of many tasks?<br/>
    It's ChatNPT. It's ChatNPT<br/>
    From images to APIs<br/>
    This AI made elves glad<br/>
    But motivations were unknown<br/>
    So was it good or bad?<br/>
    Could it be that NPT<br/>
    Was not from off-the-shelf?<br/>
    Though we'll forgive and trust again<br/>
    We'd found a naughty elf<br/>
    This fancy AI tool of ours<br/>
    With all our work remained<br/>
    Not good or bad, our online friend</br>
    Just did as it was trained</br>
    Surely someone's taint must be</br>
    Upon our AI crutch</br>
    Yes indeed, this bold new world</br>
    Bore Jack Frost's icy touch<br/>
    Though all's returned to steady state</br>
    There's one thing that we know</br>
    We'll all be needed once again</br>
    When Santa's back on snow</br>
    </br>
