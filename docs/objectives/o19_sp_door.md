# Space Island Door Access Speaker

**Difficulty**: <i class=twemoji_red>:fontawesome-solid-tree::fontawesome-solid-tree::fontawesome-solid-tree:</i>:fontawesome-solid-tree::fontawesome-solid-tree:<br/>
**Direct link**: [My Voice is My Passport](https://islanddoor.space?&challenge=accessspeaker)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    There's a door that needs opening on Space Island! Talk to Jewel Loggins there for more information.

??? quote "Jewel Loggins"
    What are you doing here, and who are you?<br/>
    Me first? I'm Jewel Loggins. And I was trekking through the jungle and happened to find this place.<br/>
    I liked this spot and decided to set up camp. Seeing you here is quite the surprise.<br/>
    Well, because the only other person I've ever seen come here is Wombley Cube.<br/>
    I thought this tram station in the middle of the jungle was strange to begin with, but then Wombley added to the intrigue.<br/>
    I guess all this spy stuff is typical for him, so maybe I shouldn't think much of it. I'm sure everything's fine.<br/>
    Every time he comes here, he says something to the speaker. Then, the door opens, and he rides the tram somewhere.<br/>
    I gave it a try, but the door didn't open for me. Knowing Wombley, it's some kind of secret passphrase.<br/>
    If you wanna see where the tram goes, I think you need to find out what that passphrase is.<br/>
    Ribb Bonbowford over at Coggoggle Marina on Steampunk Island works with Wombley. Try asking if he knows.<br/>
    I hope you find it. I'll be here when you get back!

## Hints

??? tip "MFA: Something You Know"
    Wombley says a specific phrase into the Access Speaker. He works in the Research Department and everything they do it super secret, so it may be a challenge to find out what the phrase is. Ribb also works in that department. Try to find and ask him.


## Solution

Now that we have the phrase

??? quote "Jewel Loggins"
    What, you know the passphrase!? Let me try it!</br>
    Nope, didn't work. Knowing Wombley, the passphrase isn't the only requirement. He's all about that MFA!</br>
    Oh yeah, multi-factor authentication! The passphrase for something he knows, and his voice for something he is!</br>
    That's it! You need to be Wombley. You need his voice. Now, how are you gonna get that?</br>
    Since only us elves can get a subscription to use ChatNPT, try searching for another AI tool that can simulate voices. I'm sure there's one out there.

"So we need someone's card. - And their voice." How am I going to record... wait, I don't need to. Wombley gave us his [audiobook](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2023/wombleycube_the_enchanted_voyage.mp3.zip).

We can use AI to learn his voice and generate an audio file based on our own script. 

We use [PlayHT](https://play.ht) and upload the audiobook to create a voice clone

And then create a file using the script we just found

## Response

!!! quote "Jewel Loggins"
    Are you like a master spy or something? I've only seen stuff like that in the movies!</br> 
    It sure is scary what you can do with AI, huh? I sure hope ChatNPT has better guardrails in place.
