## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Over on Steampunk Island, Bow Ninecandle is having trouble opening a padlock. Do some research and see if you can help open it!

??? quote "Bow Ninecandle"
    Hey there! I'm Bow Ninecandle, and I've got a bit of a... 'pressing' situation.<br/>
    You see, I need to get into the lavatory, but here's the twist: it's secured with a combination padlock.<br/>
    Talk about bad timing, right? I could really use your help to figure this out before things get... well, urgent.<br/>
    I'm sure there are some clever tricks and tips floating around the web that can help us crack this code without too much of a flush... I mean fuss.<br/>
    Remember, we're aiming for quick and easy solutions here - nothing too complex.<br/>
    Once we've gathered a few possible combinations, let's team up and try them out.<br/>
    I'm crossing my legs - I mean fingers - hoping we can unlock this door soon.<br/>
    After all, everyone knows that the key to holiday happiness is an accessible lavatory!<br/>
    Let's dive into this challenge and hopefully, we won't have to 'hold it' for too long! Ready to help me out?


## Solution

The standard Master... I mean Faster Combination Lock has some well documented flaws. Similar to the luggage locks, we have some tension techniques to help us identify numbers of the combination.

Here are a couple references to help us:

Watching the videos and reading, the first number can be found by applying slight tension and feeling for a sticking point. From there add 5 and that's your first number.
The second number is always a factor of +2 and then multiples of 4. So if the first number is 2, then the second number is either 4, 8, 12, 16, etc.
The third number can be found by turning the dial the opposite direction and looking for a hard sticking point.

Based on this, we see the sticking point is at about 30, which would put the first digit at 35. Moving to the second number we start with adding 2, and then going multiples of 4. We can see that reset status goes red, which indicates a wrong numbers, so we move on.

We see the second number is 5, so now we just try every number until we are able to unlock
