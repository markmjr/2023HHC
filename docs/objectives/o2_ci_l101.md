    Hey, welcome to Santa's Surf Shack on tropical Christmas Island! I'm just hanging ten here, taking it easy while brushing up on my Linux skills.<br/>
    You ever tried getting into Linux? It's a super cool way to play around with computers.<br/>
    Can you believe ChatNPT suggested this trip to the Geese Islands this year? I'm so thrilled!<br/>
    Kudos to ChatNPT, eh? The sunshine, the waves, and my surfboard â€“ simply loving it!<br/>
    So, what do you have planned? Care to join me in a Linux session?


## Solution

Linux101 covers the basics. Linux Man Pages and Googling are always good resources to use for assistance.

!!! success "Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a troll and retrieve a present!"
    [ls](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html)

!!! success "Now find the troll inside the troll."
    [cat](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) troll_19315479765589239

!!! success "Great, now remove the troll in your home directory."
    [rm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rm) troll_19315479765589239

!!! success "Print the present working directory using a command."
    [pwd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pwd.1.html)

!!! success "Good job but it looks like another troll hid itself in your home directory. Find the hidden troll!"
    ls -la

!!! success "Excellent, now find the troll in your command history."
    [history](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/history.3.html) | grep troll

!!! success "Find the troll in your environment variables."
    [printenv](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/printenv.1.html) | grep troll

!!! success "Next, head into the workshop."
    [cd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html) workshop/

!!! success "A troll is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the troll is in."
    [grep](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html) -i troll *

!!! success "A troll is blocking the present_engine from starting. Run the present_engine binary to retrieve this troll."
    [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod) +x present_engine
    ./present_engine

!!! success "Trolls have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0."
    [mv](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mv) blown_fuse0 fuse0

!!! success "Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0"
    [ln](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html) -s fuse0 fuse1

!!! success "Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2."
    [cp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html) fuse1 fuse2

!!! success "We need to make sure trolls don't come back. Add the characters "TROLL_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2."
    echo "TROLL_REPELLENT" [>>](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html) fuse2

!!! success "Find the troll somewhere in /opt/troll_den."
    [find](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) /opt/troll_den/ -iname troll.*

!!! success "Find the file somewhere in /opt/troll_den that is owned by the user troll."
    find /opt/troll_den/ -user troll

!!! success "Find the file created by trolls that is greater than 108 kilobytes and less than 110 kilobytes located somewhere in /opt/troll_den."
    find /opt/troll_den/ -size +108k -size -110k

!!! success "List running processes to find another troll."
    [ps](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html) -aux

!!! success "The 14516_troll process is listening on a TCP port. Use a command to have the only listening port display to the screen."
