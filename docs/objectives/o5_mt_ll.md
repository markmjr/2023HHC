??? quote "Garland Candlesticks"
    Hey there, I'm Garland Candlesticks! I could really use your help with something.<br/>
    You see, I have this important pamphlet in my luggage, but I just can't remember the combination to open it!<br/>
    Chris Elgee gave a talk recently that might help me with this problem. Did you attend that?<br/>
    I seem to recall Chris mentioning a technique to figure out the combinations...<br/>
    I have faith in you! We'll get that luggage open in no time.<br/>
    This pamphlet is crucial for me, so I can't thank you enough for your assistance.<br/>
    Once we retrieve it, I promise to treat you to a frosty snack on me!

## Hints

??? tip "Lock Talk"
    Check out Chris Elgee's [talk](https://youtu.be/ycM1hBSEyog) regarding his and his wife's luggage. Sounds weird but interesting!

## Solution


It's all about feel. We see that there are 5 degrees of pressure we can apply virtually. So, we begin with a single click of pressure and slowly move the closest dial until we get some resistance. We then slowly add a click or two of resistance and repeat for each dial.

If we do this right, starting with the dial closest to the button and gradually adding pressure, we should be able to unlock the bag.
